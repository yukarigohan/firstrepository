BiwaScheme has comprehensive unit test.

The test code is in test/unit.js.

h1. JSSpec

BiwaScheme is currently using "JSSpec":http://jania.pe.kr/aw/moin.cgi/JSSpec as JavaScript unit testing framework.

(In the future, we may need to implement a test framework for the PLT R6RS test suite)

h2. How to test development source (src/*.js)

Just open test/spec.html in the browser. This tests src/*.js.

h2. How to test release build (lib/biwascheme.js)

lib/biwascheme.js should be tested before each release. Append "#lib" to the url to test it.

example:
* file:///.../test/spec.html?#lib
* file:///.../test/spec.html?retun=Set&#lib
