The architecture of BiwaScheme is borrowed from the paper 
"Three Implementation Models for Scheme" by R. Kent Dybvig, 1987.
"(pdf)":http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~dyb/papers/3imp.pdf

This paper introduces three ways to implement Scheme processor:
* Chapter 3 "The heap based model"
* Chapter 4 "The stack based model" (BiwaScheme is this one)
* Chapter 5 "The string based model"

You can easily implement your own Scheme processor with this paper.
Thanks a lot to Mr. Kent Dyvbig
